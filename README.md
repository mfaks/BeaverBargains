## Introduction üöÄ

BeaverBargains was created to provide the Oregon State community with a secure platform to buy, sell, and trade items. It addresses concerns about unverified users by requiring email authentication with a .oregonstate.edu email to access the platform. This ensures that only authorized OSU community members can participate. The platform also supports users who are moving out by providing a space to give away or sell used items throughout the year, aiming to enhance community interactions and facilitate transactions within the Oregon State community.

If you do not have a .oregonstate.edu email but wish to access the platform, please contact support at [beaverbargains2024@outlook.com](mailto:beaverbargains2024@outlook.com) to request an override.
